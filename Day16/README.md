# Managing Multiple AWS Accounts with IAM Roles

In AWS, IAM roles are pivotal for managing access to various resources securely across different accounts. This guide illustrates how to create IAM roles, assign them to users or instances, and securely copy files to specific S3 buckets.

## Project 1: Assigning IAM Role to an EC2 Instance

### Steps:

1. **Create IAM Role**: 
   - Create a role with permissions for EC2 and full access to S3.
   - Generate an IAM policy granting S3 full access using the policy generator, then apply it as an inline policy to the role.

2. **Deploy EC2 Instance**: 
   - Launch an EC2 instance and attach the created IAM role to it.

3. **Copy File to S3**: 
   - Login to the EC2 instance and use the AWS CLI to copy a file to the desired S3 bucket.

## Project 2: Assigning IAM Role to a User

### Steps:

1. **Modify Trust Policy**:
   - Change the trust inline policy to include additional services like Lambda and Systems Manager (SSM).

2. **Create IAM User**:
   - Create a new IAM user and attach a custom assume role policy allowing the user to assume the created IAM role.

3. **Configure AWS CLI on Instance**:
   - Launch an EC2 instance, install required tools (e.g., unzip, awscli), and configure AWS CLI with access and secret keys.

4. **Check Identity**:
   - Verify the identity using `aws sts get-caller-identity`.

5. **Access S3 Bucket**: 
   - Use the configured user credentials to access and push files to S3 bucket, ensuring security and access control.

## Benefits of Role Assignment to Users:

- Provides granular control over resource access.
- Simplifies permission management and tracking of user actions.
- Enhances security by limiting access to specific resources based on user roles.

## Interview Question: Securely Copying File to Specific S3 Bucket

Q: How would you copy a file to a specific S3 bucket from an EC2 instance without using access and secret keys?

A: 
1. Create an IAM role without granting S3 full access.
2. Generate a custom IAM policy allowing access only to the specific S3 bucket using its ARN.
3. Attach the inline policy to the IAM role.
4. Assign the IAM role to the EC2 instance.
5. Use AWS CLI on the instance to copy files to the specified S3 bucket.
