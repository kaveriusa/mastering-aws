## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
- Create a Docker image and push it to AWS ECR.
- Set up AWS ECS to run containerized applications.
- Deploy and manage a containerized application on AWS ECS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- An AWS account.
- Docker installed on your local machine.
- AWS CLI installed and configured on your local machine.

## Setup AWS ECR

1. **Create a Repository**
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the ECR service.
   - Click on "Create repository" and follow the prompts.

2. **Authenticate Docker to Your ECR Repository**
   ```bash
   aws ecr get-login-password --region your-region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin your-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com
   ```

3. **Build and Push Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-image-name .
   docker tag your-image-name:latest your-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/your-repository-name:latest
   docker push your-account-id.dkr.ecr.your-region.amazonaws.com/your-repository-name:latest
   ```

## Setup AWS ECS

1. **Create a Cluster**
   - Navigate to the ECS service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click on "Create Cluster" and follow the prompts.

2. **Register a Task Definition**
   - Go to the "Task Definitions" section.
   - Click on "Create new Task Definition" and follow the steps, ensuring you reference the ECR image.

3. **Run a Service**
   - Go to the "Clusters" section.
   - Select your cluster and click on "Create" under the "Services" tab.
   - Follow the prompts to configure and deploy your service.

## Deploying a Containerized Application

1. **Update Service to Use New Image**
   - Whenever you push a new Docker image to ECR, update your ECS service to use the new image.
   - Go to the ECS service and select your service.
   - Click on "Update" and specify the new image version.

2. **Monitor the Service**
   - Use the ECS console to monitor the health and status of your service.
   - Check logs and metrics to ensure everything is running smoothly.
