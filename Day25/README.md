# Mastering S3 Policies: Endpoints, Access Points, and S3Fs

Welcome to the repository for our comprehensive tutorial on Amazon S3 policies and access management! This guide will walk you through the steps to create and manage S3 bucket policies, use S3 Access Points, and mount S3 as a filesystem using third-party tools.

## Introduction

This repository accompanies the YouTube video tutorial on mastering S3 policies, endpoints, and S3Fs. Follow along to learn how to securely manage access to your S3 buckets and integrate them with your workflows.

## S3 Bucket Policies

### Overview
S3 bucket policies are an integral part of IAM policies, allowing you to control access to your S3 resources. In this section, we will:
- Create a bucket and upload files.
- Set up a bucket policy to grant access to external users.
- Configure policies for specific IP addresses.
- Use preassigned URLs for secure access without making the bucket public.

### Steps
1. **Create the Bucket and Upload Files**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name
   aws s3 cp your-file.txt s3://your-bucket-name/
   ```

2. **Create Bucket Policy**:
   - Under the bucket permissions, create a policy to allow `GetObject` access to an external user.

3. **Enable Public Access**:
   - Modify the policy to enable public access as needed.

4. **IP-Based Policy**:
   - Create a policy that grants access only from specific IP addresses.

5. **Preassigned URLs**:
   - Explain and demonstrate the use of preassigned URLs for secure access.

## Access Points

### Overview
S3 Access Points simplify managing access to shared data sets in S3. In this section, we will:
- Create a bucket with access points.
- Set up policies for different users and folders.
- Manage access through access points.

### Steps
1. **Create a Bucket with Access Points**:
   ```bash
   aws s3api create-bucket --bucket your-bucket-name
   ```

2. **Create Folders and Users**:
   - Create two folders in the bucket.
   - Create `Testuser1` for `testfolder1` and `Testuser2` for `testfolder2`.
   - Attach inline policies for each user.

3. **Policy Management**:
   - Remove inline policies and delete bucket data as needed.
   - Configure access points and set permissions accordingly.

4. **Upload Data Using CLI**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp terraform3.zip s3://arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:431064776024:accesspoint/accesspointtesting1/folder1/terraform3.zip
   ```

## S3Fs

### Overview
S3Fs allows you to mount S3 buckets as filesystems on your local machine using third-party tools. This section covers:
- Setting up an Ubuntu machine.
- Installing and configuring S3Fs.

### Steps
1. **Setup Ubuntu Machine**:
   - Create an Ubuntu instance and connect to it.

2. **Install S3Fs**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install s3fs
   ```

3. **Mount S3 Bucket**:
   ```bash
   mkdir /path/to/mount
   s3fs your-bucket-name /path/to/mount -o use_cache=/tmp
   df -h | grep -i s3
   ```

## Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI installed and configured.
- AWS IAM roles and policies set up.
- Ubuntu machine for S3Fs setup.

### Installation
Follow the steps in the guide to set up your environment and install necessary tools.

## Step-by-Step Guide
Follow the detailed instructions in each section to complete the setup and configuration.
