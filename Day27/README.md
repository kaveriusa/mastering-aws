- Access to AWS Management Console.

## Active Directory Setup

### 1. Install Active Directory

1. **Install AD DS:**
   - Open Server Manager and add the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role.

2. **Disable Firewall:**
   - Open Firewall settings: `firewall.cpl`
   - Open Network Connections: `ncpa.cpl`
   - In Server Manager, turn off the firewall.

3. **Install AD DS Tools:**
   - Go to Server Manager > Manage > Add Roles and Features.
   - Select `Role Administration Tools` > `AD DS and AD LDS Tools` > `AD DS Tools`.
   - Click Next and Install.

4. **Configure Domain:**
   - Open System Properties: `sysdm.cpl`
   - Go to the Computer Name tab and click Change.
   - Set the domain to `saikiranpi.in` and enter the admin credentials.

5. **Create Users in AD:**
   - Open Active Directory Users and Computers: `dsa.msc`
   - In your domain, create two users with proper details.

## AWS Workspaces Setup

### 1. Create and Register Directory

1. **Create Directory:**
   - In the AWS Management Console, go to End User Computing > Workspaces.
   - Create a directory and register it.

2. **Register Directory:**
   - Select the registered directory and choose the subnets for your Workspaces.
   - Confirm the registration.

### 2. Launch Workspaces

1. **Launch Workspaces:**
   - In Workspaces, click Launch Workspaces.
   - Search for the users you created earlier.
   - Select the user, choose the standard with Windows bundle, and set it to AutoStop.
   - Do not select encryption (note: this will speed up the process).
   - Click Next and Launch Workspaces (this can take up to 40 minutes).

2. **Grant Access to Users:**
   - Login to your Windows machine.
   - Open Local Users and Groups Management: `lusrmgr.msc`
   - Go to Groups > Remote Desktop Users, add the user emails, and confirm.

3. **User Login:**
   - Users can now login with their credentials (e.g., `user@cloudvishwakarma.in`) via RDP.

## FSX Configuration

### 1. Create Shared Folders

1. **Access FSX:**
   - Open File Explorer and enter the FSX DNS name: `\\<FSX_DNS_Name>`
   - Create three folders: `User1`, `User2`, and `Common`.

### 2. Set Permissions

1. **Create AD Group:**
   - Go to your Windows AD and create a group called `myadmins`.
   - Add the two users to this group.

2. **Configure Folder Permissions:**
   - On the `Common` folder:
     - Right-click > Properties > Security > Edit > Add `myadmins` with Full control.
     - Go to Advanced > Disable inheritance > Remove all except `myadmins`.
   - Repeat for `User1` and `User2` folders:
     - Right-click > Properties > Security > Advanced > Disable inheritance.
     - Add the respective user with Full control and remove all others.

## Network Drive Mapping

### 1. Map Network Drive

1. **On User Machine:**
   - Open File Explorer.
   - Click This PC > Map network drive.
   - Enter `\\<FSX_DNS_Name>\share` and click Finish.

### 2. Mount to Server

1. **Access FSX:**
   - Copy the FSX DNS name.
   - On your server, open File Explorer and paste the DNS name to access the shared folders.

## Additional Notes

- For group login, additional licensing for Terminal Services may be required.
- Ensure proper permissions and security settings to maintain a secure environment.
